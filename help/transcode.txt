Command:
    audio-transcoder transcode

Description:
    Handles transcoding of .flac files to other formats.

    Transcode methods available:
        FLAC (> 24bit | > 48000) -> FLAC 16bit
        FLAC -> MP3 320
        FLAC -> MP3 V0
        FLAC -> MP3 V2

    Input directories can be treat as a single flac containing directory or the parent directory of multiple flac
    containing directories. To enable processing as a parent, use the recursive mode. When recursive mode is enabled
    the first child directories of each input directory will have it's content transcoded as required.

    During transcode, only flac files will be recognised within the provided input directories, no other files will be
    used as a transcode source.

    The transcode process automatically generates directory names to store the transcoded files (one per format) in both
    standard and recursive contexts, these directory names can be overridden on a per process basis when not in non
    interactive mode. Directory names are generated using the outputs from the 'clean-directory' command.

    All other files found within the input directory will be mirrored into the generated output directory except for
    .cue and .log files. It is assumed that these files exists as part of a CD rip and therefore are not relevant to the
    transcode outputs. Note if you have mixed directories, mp3's and flac's in the same place the transcoder process
    will carry these across, it is not the job of this application to manage file organization.

    Spectrograms can be generated for each of the transcoded files as needed.

    Multiple input directories can be passed to trigger simultaneous with a single command.

Usage:
    audio-transcoder transcode [options] <input dir>
    audio-transcoder transcode [options] <input dir> <input dir> ...

Arguments:
    <input dir>
        The directory in which to start the transcode process from.
        In the instance of recursive transcode processes, this should be the directory containing all flac containing
        directories.
        In the instance of a standard transcode process, this should be the directory to the album/containing
        directory itself.

Options:
    -e|--formats ............................ What formats to transcode to?
                                              Available formats: FLAC, 320, V0, V2
                                                  FLAC: Resample down to 16bit
                                                  320: FLAC -> MP3 320
                                                  V0: FLAC -> MP3
                                                  V2: FLAC -> V0
                                              Formats should be passed as a comma (,) separated string
                                              Example: FLAC,320,V0,V2
    -f|--force .............................. Forcefully create transcode directories
                                              If the generated name for a transcode directory all exists:
                                                  Not set: Transcode aborts
                                                  Set: Transcode deletes old directory and saves files in its place
    -o|--output-root ........................ Set the output directory.
                                              All generated transcode directories will be saved under this directory.
                                              If no argument is given, the current working directory will be used.
    -r|--recursive .......................... Enables recursive mode. Details above.
    -s|--spectrals .......................... Enables generation of spectrals for all transcoded files
    -y|--non-interactive .................... Disable any command interactivity
